 <p> Hi there! My name is Adele Di Lisio, I am 21 year old and am currently completeing a bachelor of applied science (psychology) at RMIT university. I was born in Melbourne on the 28th of February 1999 and have a strong italian background. I am a very enthusiastic person and enjoy reading and playing video games as a pastime. </p>
 
<p> 
IT is a very new area for me, as it is not my main area of study. However, growing up in an age where technology is almost everywhere and in everything we do, I have become aware of the endless possibilities and opportunities that IT can bring us. Technology held great significance during my childhood, whether that be through games or learning. Although I don’t not have much experience or knowledge of what occurs behind the scenes in IT, I am extremely eager to learn about something that has and will continue to be such a large factor in my life and the current world we live in.  </p>
