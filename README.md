 <p> Hi there! My name is Adele Di Lisio, I am 21 years old and I am currently completing a bachelor of applied science (psychology) at RMIT university. I was born in Melbourne on the 28th of February 1999 and have a strong italian background. I am a very enthusiastic person and enjoy reading and playing video games as a pastime. </p>
 
<p> 
IT is a very new area for me, as it is not my main area of study. However, growing up in an age where technology is almost everywhere and in everything we do, I have become aware of the endless possibilities and opportunities that the universal language of IT can bring us. Technology held great significance during my childhood, whether that be through video games or learning. Although I do not have much experience or knowledge of what occurs behind the scenes in IT, I am extremely eager to learn about something that has and will continue to be such a large factor in my lifestyle and in the current world we live in. I chose to study at RMIT for multiple reasons such location, convenience and its great reputation for my psychology course. When given the option to choose electives I was extremely eager to study an IT related subject, due to RMIT being reputable for its education and opportunities in IT. When beginning this subject, i did not know what to expect as it is not an area I am familiar with. However, I believe I will end this course with much better basic technological skill and knowledge on the ethics of IT. </p>
